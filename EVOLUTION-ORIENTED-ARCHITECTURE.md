## Evolution-Oriented Architecture: The Principles

1.  **Change Is Inevitable — Plan for It**
    Design systems with the expectation that capabilities will evolve, not remain static.

2.  **Limit the Blast Radius**\
    Changes should have minimal and predictable impact across the system.

3.  **Design for Modularity of Capability**\
    Every capability should be **addable, replaceable, removable, or splittable** with clear boundaries.

4.  **Know When to Rebuild**\
    Build mechanisms to recognize when incremental evolution isn’t enough — and plan for resets with clarity.

5.  **Prefer Stable Interfaces over Stable Implementations**\
    Let implementations shift freely behind interfaces that change slowly, if at all.

6.  **Trace Evolution**\
    Track architectural changes and decisions like versioned code — evolution should be observable and learnable.

7.  **Paradigm-Agnostic Architecture**\
    Whether functional or OO, design for composability, encapsulation, and independence.

8.  **Think in Futures — Bet with Purpose**\
    Don’t just prepare for change — explore the landscape of possible futures and place deliberate bets.
